# 合作键鼠 Coop KB&M
允许两个玩家使用两套键鼠进行合作，互不干扰。也可以用两个鼠标并且共享同一个键盘。反馈至GitHub。



#### 先连接键鼠再开游戏。
#### 两个角色的键位和鼠标灵敏度可以独立设置。玩家对应的键鼠可以切换。
#### 游戏光标与系统光标不重合是正常现象。
#### 系统光标在游戏中禁用，使用快捷键 Alt + Shift + X 或 Win 键来暂时启用系统光标。
#### 警告：开启“共享一个键盘”会让2P中与1P相同的按键绑定删除，请自行重新设置按键。此时按键无法与1P重复。使用手柄时最好勿开启此选项。
#### 由于全屏会阻挡第二鼠标的消息，请使用无边框代替。

Allow two players to use two sets of keyboard and mouse in coop without interfering with each other. You can also use two mice and share the same keyboard. Submit issues on GitHub.



#### Connect the keyboard and mouse first before starting the game.
#### Key Bindings and the sensitivity of the mouse of two player can be set individually. Corresponding keyboard and mouse of a certain player can be switched.
#### It is normal for the game cursor to not coincide with the system cursor.
#### The system cursor is disabled in the game, Use shortcut key Alt + Shift + X or Win to temporarily enable the system cursor.
#### Warning: Enabling 'Share One Keyboard' will cause the same key binding as 1P to be deleted in 2P, please reset the key bindings yourself. The key bindings cannot be repeated with 1P. It is best not to turn this on when using the controller.
#### Due to fullscreen blocking of messages from the second mouse, please use borderless instead.
